<p>I get products. I get people. And I love designing products that people get.</p>
<p>With a portfolio spanning web and mobile solutions across industries, I specialize in designing AI-driven experiences and workflows for complex, ever-evolving environments. My approach is fueled by curiosity, iteration, and impact—blending UX best practices, product strategy, and emerging UI trends to create solutions that just work.</p>
<p>I thrive in fast-paced environments, love a good brainstorming session, and enjoy wearing multiple hats to turn ideas into reality. Whether it’s leading stakeholder conversations, driving seamless collaboration, or crafting compelling narratives, I make design a force for clarity and connection.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I am an artist, a dancer and a performer. I love being in the spotlight to entertain either through movement or words. I love traveling, trying new cuisines, cooking, and meeting new people! An intellectually stimulating conversation, a new hobby tried or just some quality time with friends keeps me energized for weeks! If not anything, you will find me winding down with watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S for the 1000th time with a cup of steaming masala chai!</p>
